                    <h1>Like tears in rain</h1>
                    <p>Where am I going? How long have I got?</p>
                    <p>
                        I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. 
                        Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams 
                        glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time...
                        like tears in rain... Time to die.
                    </p>
                 
                     <p>
                        I don't know why he saved my life. 
                        Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. 
                        Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
                     </p>
